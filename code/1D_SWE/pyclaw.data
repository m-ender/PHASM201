Only the first 5 lines of this file are read.
The first line specifies the test model to be set up
and can be one of the following strings:

    STILL_LAKE      Flat surface, no momentum.
    WAVE            A wave in a single characteristic.
    ROSSBY          A Rossby adjustment problem.
    GEOSTROPHIC     A Gausssian hump of water in
                    geostrophic equilibrium.
    STEADY_FLOW     Uniform flow at a specified velocity.
                    A transversal pressure gradient will
                    be imposed to prevent tilting of the
                    surface along y.

The second line specifies the bathymetry and can be one
of the following strings:

    FLAT            Flat bottom, B = 0
    SLOPE           Linear slope increasing with x
    GAUSSIAN        B = 0.5*exp(-128*x^2)
    COSINE          B = 0.5*cos(pi*x*4) for |x| < 0.125
                        0               otherwise
    PARABOLIC_HUMP  B = 0.5 - 32*x^2    for |x| < 0.125
                        0               otherwise
    PARABOLIC_BOWL  B = 2*x^2
    CLIFF           B = (tanh(100x)+1)/4

The third value is the number cells to use along x.
The fourth value is the maximum time T of the simulation.
The fifth value is the Kelvin number K for the simulation.
The sixth value is the initial x-velocity of the domain.
    This value is only used for the STEADY_FLOW model.
