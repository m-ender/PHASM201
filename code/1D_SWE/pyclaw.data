Only the first 4 lines of this file are read.
The first line specifies the test model to be set up
and can be one of the following strings:

    STILL_LAKE      Flat surface, no momentum
    ROSSBY          A Rossby adjustment problem
    GEOSTROPHIC     A Gausssian hump of water in
                    geostrophic equilibrium.

The second line specifies the bathymetry and can be one
of the following strings:

    FLAT            Flat bottom, B = 0
    GAUSSIAN        B = 0.5*exp(-128*x^2)
    PARABOLIC_HUMP  B = 0.5 - 32*x^2    for |x| < 0.25
                        0              otherwise
    PARABOLIC_BOWL  B = 2*x^2

The second value is the maximum time T of the simulation.
The third value is the Kelvin number K for the simulation.
