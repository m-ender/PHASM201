\chapter{Results}
\label{ch:results}

This chapter presents results for the four solvers. For each of the five initial conditions, the solvers will be compared for a few representative bathymetries. Reference results were obtained using the unbalanced solver from Section~\ref{sec:roe} on a very fine grid of 10,000 cells. At the end, the execution time of the different solvers is compared as well.

\begin{itemize}
  \item show how unbalanced method fails
  \item go through different methods, showing where they work and where they fail
