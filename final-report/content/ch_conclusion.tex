\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch:conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
  \item quick recap
  \item pros and cons of the individual methods
  \item future work:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item derive more general Rogers solver for uniform flow
    \item what's with the growth of the still water solver for Gaussian geostrophic equilibrium?
    \item discrepancy with Rogers
    \item model additional effects/account for dry states
    \item look into methods that aren't Riemann problem based
    \item put more effort into choice of root for LeVeque solver
  \end{itemize}
